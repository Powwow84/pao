We describe new capabilities for modeling bilevel programs within
the Pyomo modeling software.  These capabilities include new modeling
components that represent subproblems, modeling transformations for
re-expressing models with bilevel structure in other forms, and
optimize bilevel programs with meta-solvers that apply transformations
and then perform optimization on the resulting model.  We illustrate
the breadth of Pyomo's modeling capabilities for bilevel programs,
and we describe how Pyomo's meta-solvers can perform local and
global optimization of bilevel programs.
