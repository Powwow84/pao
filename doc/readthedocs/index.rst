PAO Documentation | DRAFT
=========================

PAO is a Python-based package for Adversarial Optimization.  The goal of
this package is to provide a general modeling and analysis capability for
bilevel, trilevel and other multi-level optimization forms that express
adversarial dynamics.  PAO integrates two different modeling abstractions:

* *Algebraic models* that extend the modeling concepts in the
  `Pyomo <https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo>`_ algebraic modeling language
  to express problems with an intuitive algebraic syntax.

* *Compact models* that express objective and constraints in a manner
  that is typically used to express the mathematical form of these problems
  (e.g. using vector and matrix data types).
