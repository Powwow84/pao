PAO Documentation | DRAFT
=========================

PAO is a Python-based package for Adversarial Optimization.  PAO extends
the modeling concepts in `Pyomo <https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo>`_
to enable the expression and solution of multi-level optimization
problems. The goal of this package is to provide a general   modeling
and analysis capability, and application exemplars serve to illustrate
PAO's general capabilities.
