duality

. Should this package expose specific dualization functions?

. Should we create an error if there is more than one objective when creating a linear dual?
This would further slow down the dualization process

. Should we setup a linear dualization function that does not do string manipulation?  This might be significantly faster.

. What other dualizations should be supported?  Quadratic?  Lagrangian?


bilevel

. Do we need an indexed SubModel class?
